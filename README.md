# Expenses-and-Budget-Tracker
The Expense & Budget Tracker is a GUI-based personal finance tool built in Python using Tkinter.
Its primary purpose is to help users log daily expenses, set monthly budgets, and analyze their spending habits through clear reports and visual charts.
This project simplifies everyday money management by allowing users to enter expense details, store them locally, and view summaries that promote better financial decision-making.
